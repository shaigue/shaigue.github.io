Welcome to my website! I'm an algorithms engineer and researcher with a passion for tackling hard problems and constantly learning new things. I strongly believe in combining hands-on experience with a deep understanding of concepts and have excellent communication and teamwork abilities.

Recently, I completed my MSc in Computer Science at the [Technion](https://cs.technion.ac.il/), where I focused on [Algorithmic Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_game_theory) and [Formal Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) under the guidance of [Shaull Almagor](https://shaull.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/). I'm currently seeking my next challenge as an algorithms engineer/researcher or software engineer working on complex systems. My areas of interest include artificial intelligence, machine learning, engineering, and mathematics, and I particularly enjoy exploring the intersection of these fields.

In addition to my work in computer science, I have a strong interest in learning science and how we can optimize our learning processes. I believe that better understanding how we learn can lead to positive impacts on society, and I'm always excited to explore new ideas in this area. If you have any thoughts or ideas on this topic, I'd love to hear from you!

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
