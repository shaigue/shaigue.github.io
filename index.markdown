Hello, my name is Shai! 


I'm an algorithm developer at Mobileye, working on autonomous driving and driver assistance. I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously learning. I'm passionate about both machine and human learning, and strongly believe that real-world experience, combined with deep theoretical knowledge and soft skills, creates a strong foundation.


In addition to my work in computer science, I’m interested in how we learn and how we can learn more effectively. I believe that better understanding learning and applying it to our daily lives can benefit society. I’m always eager to explore new ideas in this area. If you have any thoughts, I’d love to hear from you!


Before taking on my current role, I completed my MSc in computer science at the [Technion](https://cs.technion.ac.il/), where I specialized in *Algorithmic Game Theory* and *Formal Verification* under the guidance of [Shaull Almagor](https://shaull.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/). My thesis is titled "Concurrent Games With Multiple Topologies".
