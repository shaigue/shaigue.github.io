Recently completed my MSc at the 
[Computer Science department at the Technion](https://cs.technion.ac.il/), 
supervised by [Dr. Shaull Almagor](https://shaull.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/) 
in the fields of 
[Algorithmic Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_game_theory) 
and [Formal Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods).

Interested in algorithms, math, machine learning, software engineering, 
and everything computer science related. Looking for my next challenge.
