My master's thesis was in the fascinating field of Theoretical Computer Science (TCS), which blends computer science with mathematics. The thing that made it so captivating was that I didn't have to worry about compiling code or debugging errors - it was just me and my ideas. This experience made me acutely aware of my cognitive process, from my concentration levels to the various ways I could approach a problem to boost my creativity.

Throughout my thesis, I collected valuable tips from peers and advisors that helped me make steady progress. This piqued my interest in discovering more effective approaches to tackling TCS problems. I interviewed several researchers and grad students and researched online to gather a variety of opinions and ideas.

This paper summarizes the main findings from my study and sheds light on effective ways to tackle TCS challenges.

*This is work-in-progress. Paper will soon be available.*
