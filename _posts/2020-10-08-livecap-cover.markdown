During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a project in the Geometric Image Processing lab at the Technion. Our project aimed to partially reproduce the paper [LiveCap](https://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/LiveCap/), which focuses on motion capture using a single camera. We aimed to fit a 3D model of a person to the movements seen on camera by fitting a skeleton to its 3D model and optimizing skeleton movements using pose estimation techniques.

You can learn more about our project by checking out the [report](/static/reports/livecap_cover_report.pdf) and the [slides](/static/slides/livecap_cover_slides.pdf). Our project's code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/izosak/LiveCapCover.git).
