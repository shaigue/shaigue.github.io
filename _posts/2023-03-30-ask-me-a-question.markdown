In this project, I did a very simple thing. I asked some friends if there is a question that they would like to be asked. Then, I asked them that question. It turned out quite interesting.

The idea behind this project is to use dialog to learn and get a better understanding of the world. I found conversations to be very useful while working on my MSc thesis, and I wondered if the same conversations could be used for our personal research projects. 

I think most of us have personal research projects, but we might not call them “research projects”. Formalizing your research questions is an important first step in any research project, this is why I asked people to think about the question that they would like to be asked. In essence, it’s asking them to formalize their research questions.

During the conversation, I tried to help participants to process their thoughts about their question by using a form of [Socratic dialog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_dialogue), which emphasizes listening and asking questions.
